        <p>
            I am from Redding, CA, which is up north by Oregon. 
            I am studying software engineering, and I only have a few 
            semesters left. I have switched majors a couple times, so I 
            have also done a year in computer engineering and a year in 
            mechanical engineering.

            I am married to my wife Renee. She is from northwest Indiana.
            We have been married for about 2 years now, and currently do 
            not have any kids. We do have a dog named Buster and he is a
            lab/bloodhound mix.

            One of my interests and I guess hobbies is working on and 
            learning about cars. I enjoy figuring out how they work and 
            how I can fix them myself. It makes my wife happy that I enjoy
            fixing our cars because she likes not having to pay a mechanic...

            Here are some pics of me working on my car's brakes with my dog, 
            and a pic of when I got to meet a drage racing team as a kid.
